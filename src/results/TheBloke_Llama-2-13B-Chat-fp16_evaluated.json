For example, the `MOD` variable is defined on the same line as the `import numpy as np` statement, which can make it difficult to see at a glance what the `MOD` variable represents. Additionally, some of the lines are very long and contain multiple statements, which can make the code harder to read.\n\nTo improve readability, you could use consistent indentation and line breaks throughout the code. For example, you could indent the `MOD` variable definition and the `n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))` line, and break up the long lines into shorter ones. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's the code with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef resolve():\n    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\n    n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a = [int(eval(input())) for _ in range(m)]\n\n    dp = np.array([1] * (n + 1))\n    dp[a] = 0\n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if dp[i]!= 0:\n            dp[i] = np.sum(dp[i - 2:i]) % MOD\n\n    print((dp[n]))\n\nresolve()\n```\nThis will make the code easier to read and understand, and will help others (and yourself) to better understand the code and make changes or improvements as needed.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nx, y, z, k = list(map(int, input().split()))\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort(reverse=True)\nb.sort(reverse=True)\nc.sort(reverse=True)\nabc = []\nfor i, _a in enumerate(a):\n    for j, _b in enumerate(b):\n        if (i+1) * (j+1) > k:\n            break\n        for l, _c in enumerate(c):\n            if (i+1) * (j+1) * (l+1) > k:\n                break\n            abc.append(_a + _b + _c)\nabc.sort(reverse=True)\nfor x in abc[:k]:\n    print(x)\n```\n```\n\nSure! Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nUse consistent indentation and line breaks to make the code more readable.\n\nCurrently, the code has inconsistent indentation and line breaks, which can make it harder to read and understand. It would be better to use consistent indentation and line breaks throughout the code. For example, you could use 4 spaces for each level of indentation, and break long lines into multiple lines when necessary. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could look with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nx, y, z, k = list(map(int, input().split()))\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Sort the lists\na.sort(reverse=True)\nb.sort(reverse=True)\nc.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the result list\nabc = []\n\n# Loop through the lists and find the combinations\nfor i, _a in enumerate(a):\n    for j, _b in enumerate(b):\n        for l, _c in enumerate(c):\n            if (i + 1) * (j + 1) * (l + 1) > k:\n                break\n            abc.append(_a + _b + _c)\n\n# Sort the result list\nabc.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Print the results\nfor x in abc[:k]:\n    print(x)\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's easier to see the structure of the code and how it works.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Currently, the code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nAdditionally, some of the variable names are quite long and could be broken down into smaller, more descriptive names. For example, `D` could be renamed to `dictionary` or `dict`, `L` could be renamed to `list_of_primes`, `M` could be renamed to `number_of_primes`, and `N` could be renamed to `number_of_elements`. This will make the code easier to read and understand, as well as reduce the risk of typos and errors.\n\nFinally, the code could benefit from additional comments to explain what each section of the code is doing. For example, the `make_fact` function is not well documented, and it is not clear what the purpose of the `doubling` and `inved` functions are. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code will make it easier for others to understand and maintain the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

In the current code, some lines are indented with 4 spaces, while others are indented with 8 spaces. Consistent indentation makes the code easier to read and understand.\n\nAdditionally, consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code. For example, you could add a comment before the `dict` definition to explain what the dictionary is for, and another comment before the `primes` list comprehension to explain what the list comprehension is doing. This will make the code easier to understand for someone who is not familiar with it.\n\nHere's the updated code with consistent indentation and additional comments:\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n\n# Dictionary to store the number of times each prime appears in the list\ndict = {i: [0] for i in range(1, n + 1)}\n\n# Initialize the list of primes\nprimes = [i for i in range(n + 1) if dict[i][0] == 2]\n\n# Find the number of primes less than or equal to n\nfor i in range(n + 1):\n    dict[i][0] += 1\n    dict[i].append(i)\n\n# Find the number of elements less than or equal to n\nfor i in range(n + 1):\n    dict[i][1] += 1\n\n# Calculate the number of elements in the list\nfor i in range(n + 1):\n    dict[i][2] += 1\n\n# Calculate the number of prime factors of n\ndef make_fact(n, k):\n    # Initialize the list of prime factors\n    ll = [0 for _ in range(k)]\n\n    # Iterate over the primes less than or equal to n\n    for i in primes:\n        # Calculate the number of times the prime appears in the list\n        ll[i] = n // i\n\n    # Calculate the remaining factors\n    for i in range(k):\n        ll[i] += (n % i) // (i + 1)\n\n    return ll\n\n# Calculate the number of prime factors of n modulo modulo\ndef doubling(n, m, modulo=mod):\n    # Initialize the result\n    y = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the primes less than or equal to n\n    for i in primes:\n        # Calculate the number of times the prime appears in the list\n        y *= n // i\n\n        # Calculate the remaining factors\n        for j in range(i + 1, m + 1):\n            y *= j // (i + 1)\n\n    return y % modulo\n\n# Calculate the number of prime factors of n modulo modulo\ndef inved(a, modulo=mod):\n    # Initialize the result\n    x = 1\n\n    # Iterate over the primes less than or equal to n\n    for i in primes:\n        # Calculate the number of times the prime appears in the list\n        x *= a // i\n\n        # Calculate the remaining factors\n        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):\n            x *= j // (i + 1)\n\n    return x % modulo\n\n# Calculate the number of prime factors of n\nfact = make_fact(n, maxf + 1)\n\n# Calculate the number of prime factors of n modulo modulo\ninvf = inved(fact, modulo)\n\n# Print the result\nfor i in range(1, n + 2):\n    print(invf[i - 1])\n```\nI hope this helps!

This will make the code's structure more visible and easier to understand.\n\nHere's the code with consistent indentation:\n```\nn, k = input_values(input().split())\nz = output(10**5 + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n  a, b = input_values(input().split())\n  z[a] += b\n\na = 0\nfor i in range(1, 10**5 + 1):\n  if k <= z[i]:\n    a = i\n    break\n  k -= z[i]\n\nprint((int(a)))\n```\nWith consistent indentation, the code's structure is more visible, and it's easier to understand the flow of the program.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

It would be better to use consistent indentation and line breaks to make the code more readable.\n\nFor example, you could add four spaces before the `for` loop condition and the `if` statement inside the loop, like this:\n```\nfor abi in abn:\n    a, b = abi\n    if not ts + a <= b:\n        enable = False\n        break\n    else:\n        ts += a\n```\nThis will make the code easier to read and understand, and it will also make it more consistent with other coding conventions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's the code with my suggested improvements:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nN = int(eval(input()))\nMax_List = []\nN_List = [i for i in range(3)]\nfor i in range(N):\n    Current_List = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    if i == 0:\n        Max_List.append(Current_List)\n    else:\n        Current_Max_List = []\n        for j in range(3):\n            Index_List = np.array(Max_List[i - 1])\n            ind = np.ones(3, dtype=bool)\n            ind[j] = False\n            Current_Max_List.append(max(Index_List[ind]) + Current_List[j])\n        \n        Max_List.append(Current_Max_List)\n\nprint((max(Max_List[-1])))\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nN = int(eval(input()))\ninput_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\nnum_elements = len(input_list)\neven_indices = input_list[input_list % 2 == 0]\nsolution = len(even_indices)\nwhile num_elements > 0:\n    even_indices = even_indices[even_indices % 2 == 0]\n    solution += len(even_indices)\n    num_elements -= len(even_indices)\nprint(solution)\n```\n```\n\nSure! Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nOne thing that jumps out at me is the use of `eval(input())` to get the value of `N`. This can be a security risk, as it can execute arbitrary code. Instead, you could use `int(input())` to get the value of `N` as an integer.\n\nAdditionally, the code uses a mix of snake_case and camelCase for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use snake_case for all variable names, like this:\n```\nN = int(input())\ninput_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\nnum_elements = len(input_list)\neven_indices = input_list[input_list % 2 == 0]\nsolution = len(even_indices)\n```\nThis will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nOverall, the code is well-structured and easy to follow, but these small changes can make it even more readable.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

For example, instead of using `a`, `b`, `j`, and `tmp`, consider using more descriptive names like `input_list`, `current_value`, `next_value`, and `total_value`. This will make the code easier to understand and follow, as the variable names will provide more context about their purpose.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider breaking up the long line `a = [int(eval(input())) for _ in range(m)] + [0]` into multiple lines for better readability. For example:\n```\na = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    a.append(int(eval(input())))\na.append(0)\n```\nThis will make the code easier to read and understand, as it will be broken up into smaller, more manageable chunks.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use a more descriptive variable name for the input variable `eval(input())`. Instead of using a generic name like `eval`, it would be better to use a name that clearly communicates the purpose of the variable. For example, you could use `num_factors_input` or `factorial_input`. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n\nHere's the code with the suggested change:\n```\nnum_factors_input = int(eval(input()))\nprint((math.factorial(num_factors_input) % (10 ** 9 + 7)))\n```\nI hope this helps!

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nOne thing that jumps out at me is the use of variable names that are very long and contain multiple words. This can make the code harder to read and understand, especially for someone who is skimming through the code quickly. Instead of using long variable names like `input_list`, `number_of_elements`, and `current_element`, consider using shorter and more descriptive variable names. For example, you could use `input_list` instead of `list(map(int, input_list.split()))`, `num_elements` instead of `number_of_elements`, and `cur_element` instead of `current_element`. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider breaking up the long line of code into multiple lines for better readability. For example, instead of having the entire loop in one line, you could break it up into multiple lines like this:\n```\nfor current_element in input_list[1:number_of_elements]:\n    total_sum = 0\n    for l in zip(*input_list[number_of_elements:]):\n        total_sum += sum(s * t for s, t in zip(current_element, l))\n    print(total_sum)\n```\nThis will make the code easier to read and understand, and will also make it more maintainable in the long run.",

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nOne thing that jumps out at me is the use of variable names that are very long and contain multiple words. This can make the code harder to read and understand, especially for someone who is skimming through the code quickly. Instead of using long variable names like `input_list`, `number_of_elements`, and `current_element`, consider using shorter and more descriptive variable names. For example, you could use `input_list` instead of `list(map(int, input_list.split()))`, `num_elements` instead of `number_of_elements`, and `cur_element` instead of `current_element`. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider breaking up the long line of code into multiple lines for better readability. For example, instead of having the entire loop in one line, you could break it up into multiple lines like this:\n```\nfor current_element in input_list[1:number_of_elements]:\n    total_sum = 0\n    for l in zip(*input_list[number_of_elements:]):\n        total_sum += sum(s * t for s, t in zip(current_element, l))\n    print(total_sum)\n```\nThis will make the code easier to read and understand, and will also make it more maintainable in the long run.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

This will make the code easier to understand and communicate what the variables represent.\n\nHere's the code with my suggested variable names:\n\n```\nn = int(eval(input()))\ninput_list = list(map(int, input().split()))\nimport itertools as it\nimport numpy as np\ncombinations = list(it.combinations(input_list, 2))\ntotal_product = 0\nfor combination in combinations:\n    total_product += np.prod(combination)\nprint(total_product)\n```\n\nBy using more descriptive variable names, the code becomes easier to read and understand, and it's clearer what the code is doing.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use consistent indentation throughout the code. The current code uses inconsistent indentation, with some lines indented more than others. This can make the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to stick to a consistent indentation of 4 spaces for all lines. This will make the code more visually appealing and easier to read.\n\nFor example, here's the code with consistent indentation:\n```\nN = int(eval(input()))\nnumber_of_non_zero_digits = [[0] * 9 for i in range(9)]\ntotal_count = 0\nfor digit_index in range(1, N + 1):\n    if digit_index[-1]!= \"0\":\n        non_zero_digits_left = int(digit_index[0]) - 1\n        non_zero_digits_right = int(digit_index[-1]) - 1\n        number_of_non_zero_digits[non_zero_digits_left][non_zero_digits_right] += 1\nfor digit_position in range(1, 10):\n    for digit_index in range(1, 10):\n        total_count += number_of_non_zero_digits[digit_position - 1][digit_index - 1] * number_of_non_zero_digits[digit_index - 1][digit_position - 1]\nprint(total_count)\n```\nWith consistent indentation, the code is easier to read and understand, and it becomes more visually appealing.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use more descriptive variable names throughout the code.

This will make the code easier to understand and maintain, as the variable names will be more self-explanatory.\n\nHere's the code with the suggested variable names:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nmax_value, input_value = list(map(int, input().split()))\narray_of_ints = np.array(list(map(int, input().split())))\ncumulative_sum = np.sort(array_of_ints).cumsum()\nif cumulative_sum[-1] < input_value:\n    print(number_of_elements - 1)\nelif cumulative_sum[-1] == input_value:\n    print(number_of_elements)\nelse:\n    print(np.where(cumulative_sum <= input_value)[0].shape[0])\n```\nI hope this helps!

Currently, some lines are indented with 4 spaces, while others are indented with 8 spaces. Consistently using 4 spaces for indentation would make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to add comments to explain what each section of the code is doing. For example, the `dis` dictionary is not well-documented, and it's not immediately clear what it represents or how it's used in the code. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each variable and the logic of each section of the code would make it easier for someone reading the code to understand what's going on.\n\nFinally, it's worth considering using a more descriptive name for the `dis` dictionary, as the current name doesn't give any hint about what it represents. A more descriptive name, such as `distance_matrix`, might make the code easier to understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text.

Additionally, consider using more descriptive variable names to make the code even more readable.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use more descriptive variable names throughout the code. For example, instead of using `exp`, `l`, and `ans`, consider using variables like `exponents`, `cumulative_sum`, and `maximum_value`. This will make the code easier to understand and communicate what each variable represents.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider breaking up the long line of code into multiple lines for easier readability. For example, you could break up the `for` loop into multiple lines like this:\n```\nfor i in range(0, n - k):\n    x = l[i + k] - l[i]\n    ans = max(ans, x)\n```\nThis will make the code easier to read and understand, and will also make it more visually appealing.\n\nOverall, with these small changes, the code will be more readable and easier to understand for other developers who may need to work with it in the future.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\nimport fractions\n\ndef lcm(number1, number2):\n    return (number1 * number2) // gcd(number1, number2)\n\nN = int(eval(input()))\nprint((lcm(N, 2)))\n```\n```\n\n\nSure! Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use descriptive variable names that clearly convey the purpose of each variable. For example, instead of using `N` as a variable name, you could use `number_of_students` or `student_count`. This will make the code easier to understand and reduce the need for comments to explain what each variable represents.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider using a consistent naming convention throughout the code. The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code.
