The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\ndef c_repsept():\n    K = int(eval(input()))\n\n    L = 9 * K // 7 if K % 7 == 0 else 9 * K\n    if L % 2 == 0 or L % 5 == 0:\n        return -1\n\n    remainder = 1\n    for n in range(1, L + 1):\n        remainder = (10 * remainder) % L\n        if remainder == 1:\n            return n\n    return -1\n\nprint((c_repsept()))\n```\n\nMy suggestion is to add comments to explain the purpose and logic of the code. Currently, the code lacks any comments, which can make it difficult for someone else (or even yourself in the future) to understand the code's intention and how it achieves its goal.

The current code uses variable names like \"x2\" and \"sum_x\" which may not immediately convey their purpose or meaning. By using more descriptive names, it will be easier for someone reading the code to understand what each variable represents and how it is being used. For example, instead of \"x2\", you could use \"squared_array\" and instead of \"sum_x\", you could use \"sum_of_elements\". This will improve the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text.

The current code uses variable names like \"s\", \"k\", \"count\", \"shoko_count\", and \"kosa_count\", which don't provide much information about their purpose or meaning. By using more descriptive names, it will be easier for someone reading the code to understand what each variable represents and how it is being used.

The current code uses single-letter variable names like N, K, D, arr, etc. These names don't provide much information about what the variables represent or their purpose in the code. By using more descriptive names, it will be easier for someone reading the code to understand what each variable is used for and how it contributes to the overall logic of the program.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

These names don't provide much information about what the variables represent or their purpose in the code. Using more descriptive names will make the code easier to understand and maintain.

The current code uses single-letter variable names like \"K\", \"G\", \"n\", \"e\", etc. These names don't provide much information about what the variables represent or their purpose in the code. Using more descriptive names will make the code easier to understand and follow. For example, instead of \"K\", you could use \"num_nodes\" or \"num_vertices\". Instead of \"G\", you could use \"adjacency_list\" or \"graph\". This will make the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.
