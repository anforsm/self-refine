Additionally, the indentation is not consistent, with some lines having more than 4 spaces of indentation.\nTo improve readability, it would be better to use consistent line breaks and indentation throughout the code. For example, you could use 80 characters per line and consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces) for all lines. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could be modified to use consistent line breaks and indentation:\n```\ndef consistent_indentation(code):\n    # Replace the current indentation with consistent indentation\n    return code\n\n\nH, W, K = list(map(int, input().split()))\nMOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\nHd = sum([d * (H - d) * (W ** 2) for d in range(H)])\nWd = sum([d * (W - d) * (H ** 2) for d in range(W)])\n# \u968e\u4e57 & \u9006\u5143\u8a08\u7b97\u7b97\u7b97\u7b97\u7b97\nfactorial = [1]\ninverse = [1]\nfor i in range(1, H * W + 2):\n    factorial.append(factorial[-1] * i % MOD)\n    inverse.append(pow(factorial[-1], MOD - 2, MOD))\nans = (Hd + Wd) * factorial[H * W - 2] * inverse[K - 2] * inverse[H * W - K] % MOD\nprint(ans)\n```\nBy using consistent line breaks and indentation, the code will be easier to read and understand, and the reader will be able to focus on the logic of the code without being distracted by the inconsistent formatting.",

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse descriptive variable names:\nThe current code uses very generic variable names like `input_values`, `n`, `max_value`, `answer`, and `j`. While these names are sufficient for understanding the code, they don't provide much context or insight into what the variables represent.\nTo improve readability, consider using more descriptive variable names that clearly indicate their purpose. For example, you could use `input_values` to represent the list of input values, `n` to represent the number of input values, `max_value` to represent the maximum value in the input list, `answer` to represent the sum of the input values, and `j` to represent the current position in the input list.\nBy using more descriptive variable names, you can make the code easier to understand and follow, especially for other developers who may need to work with the code in the future.",
