The current code uses variable names like `num_elements`, `input_sequence`, `unclosed_parentheses`, etc. These names are not very clear and can make it harder to understand the code. It would be better to use more descriptive names that convey the purpose or meaning of the variables. For example, instead of `num_elements`, you could use something like `sequence_length`. Instead of `unclosed_parentheses`, you could use `unclosed_count` or `unclosed_bracket_count`. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n"
