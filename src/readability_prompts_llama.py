Example of code critique:
I have some code. Can you give one suggestion to improve readability. Don't fix the code, just give a suggestion.

```
A, B, C, X, Y = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5
for i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):
    s = i * 2 * C + max(0, X - i) * A + max(0, Y - i) * B
    ans = min(ans, s)
```

My suggestion is to use a consistent naming convention throughout the code. The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.
