The current code uses variable names like `num_rows_input`, `max_values_per_row`, and `current_row_values`, which can be a bit vague and make it harder to understand the purpose of each variable. It would be better to use more descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of each variable. For example, you could use names like `num_rows`, `max_values`, and `row_values` to make the code more readable and self-explanatory.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names.

The current code uses generic variable names like \"count\", \"result\", \"previous\", \"array\", and \"index\". Using more descriptive names can make the code easier to understand and follow. For example, instead of \"count\", you could use \"total_students\" or \"student_count\". Instead of \"result\", you could use \"group_assignments\" or \"student_group_mapping\". This will make the code more self-explanatory and improve readability.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text.

Currently, there are some commented out lines that suggest different approaches or ideas, but it would be helpful to have comments that explain why those approaches were not used or what the intention was. Additionally, adding comments to describe the purpose of each loop or calculation would make it easier for someone reading the code to understand the overall flow and logic.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.
