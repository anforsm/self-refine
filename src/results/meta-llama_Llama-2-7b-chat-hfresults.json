Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nUse whitespace more consistently to make the code more readable.\n\nIn the current code, there are some places where there are too many consecutive lines of code without any whitespace in between. For example, the `readline` and `readlines` functions are defined on the same line as the `N` variable, which can make it hard to understand what each variable represents.\n\nBy adding some whitespace between these lines, you can make the code easier to read and understand:\n```\nimport sys\n\nread = sys.stdin.buffer.read\nreadline = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\nreadlines = sys.stdin.buffer.readlines\n\nN = int(read())\n\nx = N + (-N) % 1000\n\nprint(x)\n```\nThis makes the code more readable and easier to understand, as each line is more clearly defined and separated from the others.",

For example, you could use four spaces for indentation and a single space between words. This will make the code easier to read and understand, and will help you catch errors more quickly.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could look with consistent indentation and spacing:\n```\nimport numpy as np\ndef resolve():\n    # MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\n    n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a = [int(eval(input())) for _ in range(m)]\n    # Initialize the dp array\n    dp = np.array([1] * (n + 1))\n    dp[a] = 0\n    # Calculate the value of dp[i] based on the previous values\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if dp[i]!= 0:\n            dp[i] = np.sum(dp[i - 2:i]) % MOD\n    # Print the final value of dp[n]\n    print((dp[n]))\n    \nresolve()\n```\nI hope this helps!
