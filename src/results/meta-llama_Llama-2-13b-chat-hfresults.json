This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could look with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nx, y, z, k = list(map(int, input().split()))\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Sort the lists\na.sort(reverse=True)\nb.sort(reverse=True)\nc.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the result list\nabc = []\n\n# Loop through the lists and find the combinations\nfor i, _a in enumerate(a):\n    for j, _b in enumerate(b):\n        for l, _c in enumerate(c):\n            if (i + 1) * (j + 1) * (l + 1) > k:\n                break\n            abc.append(_a + _b + _c)\n\n# Sort the result list\nabc.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Print the results\nfor x in abc[:k]:\n    print(x)\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's easier to see the structure of the code and how it works.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Currently, some lines are indented with 4 spaces, while others are indented with 8 spaces. Consistently using 4 spaces for indentation would make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's the code with consistent 4-space indentation:\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n\n# Create a dictionary to store the number of times each prime appears in the list\ndict = {i: [0] for i in range(1, n + 1)}\nfor i in range(n + 1):\n    dict[a[i]][0] += 1\n    dict[a[i]].append(i)\n\n# Find the prime factors of n\npl, pr = 0, 0\nfor i in dict:\n    if dict[i][0] == 2:\n        pl = dict[i][1]\n        pr = dict[i][2]\n        break\n\n# Calculate the number of prime factors of n\nL = pl\nM = pr - pl - 1\nN = n - pr\n\n# Calculate the modulo of n\nmod = int(1e9) + 7\n\n# Calculate the factorial of n\nfact = [1 for _ in range(maxf + 1)]\nfor i in range(maxf):\n    fact[i + 1] = (fact[i] * (i + 1)) % mod\n\n# Calculate the inverse of n modulo the modulo\ninvf = [1 for _ in range(maxf + 1)]\nfor i in range(maxf):\n    invf[i - 1] = inved(fact[i - 1], mod)\n\n# Calculate the result of the multiplication of the prime factors of n\nfor i in range(1, n + 2):\n    S = fact[n] * invf[i - 1] * invf[n - i + 1] % mod\n    if i <= n - M:\n        S -= fact[n - M - i] * invf[i - 1] * invf[n - M - i] % mod\n    if i <= n:\n        S += fact[n - i] * invf[i - 1] * invf[n - i] % mod\n    print(S)\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more suggestions for improving readability.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Additionally, some lines are too long and could be broken up into multiple lines for better readability.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could be formatted with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\ndef isPrime(x):\n    if x == 2:\n        return True\n    if x < 2 or x % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i, root_x = 3, int(pow(x, 0.5))\n    while i <= root_x:\n        if x % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n\nprimes = [2]\nfor i in range(3, 104730):\n    if isPrime(i):\n        primes.append(primes[-1] + i)\n\nwhile True:\n    n = int(eval(input()))\n    if n == 0:\n        break\n    print(primes[n - 1])\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's clearer how the different parts of the code fit together.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code. The current code uses inconsistent indentation and spacing, which can make the code harder to read. For example, some lines have four spaces of indentation, while others have only two spaces. Additionally, some lines have extra spaces before or after the equals sign, while others do not.\n\nTo improve readability, it would be better to use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the code. For example, you could use four spaces of indentation for all lines, and add no extra spaces before or after the equals sign. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's the code with my suggested improvements:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nN = int(eval(input()))\nMax_List = []\nN_List = [i for i in range(3)]\nfor i in range(N):\n    Current_List = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    if i == 0:\n        Max_List.append(Current_List)\n    else:\n        Current_Max_List = []\n        for j in range(3):\n            Index_List = np.array(Max_List[i - 1])\n            ind = np.ones(3, dtype=bool)\n            ind[j] = False\n            Current_Max_List.append(max(Index_List[ind]) + Current_List[j])\n        \n        Max_List.append(Current_Max_List)\n\nprint((max(Max_List[-1])))\n```\nI hope this helps!

This will make the code easier to understand and follow, especially for someone reading the code for the first time.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could be improved with more descriptive variable names:\n\n```\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\nsys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)\n\nK, S = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 0\nfor number in range(K+1):\n    for index in range(K+1):\n        position = S - (number + index)\n        if position >= 0 and position <= K:\n            ans += 1\nprint(ans)\n```\n\nBy using more descriptive variable names, the code becomes easier to understand and follow, and it's easier to see what the code is doing just by looking at the variable names.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nOne thing that jumps out at me is the use of redundant variable names. In the `problems` list, both `b` and `-a` are assigned to the same list element. Instead of using two separate variables, you could use a single variable with a more descriptive name to represent the pair. For example, you could use `problem` instead of `b` and `-a`, like this:\n```\nproblems.append((problem, -a))\n```\nThis would make the code easier to read and understand, as it would eliminate the need to keep track of two separate variables.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider using a more consistent naming convention throughout the code. As you mentioned, the code currently uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make it harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code, such as using camelCase for all variable names or snake_case for all variable names. This would make the code more consistent and easier to understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use more descriptive variable names throughout the code. For example, instead of using `n`, `input_list`, `total`, `average`, `squared_sum`, and `minimum`, consider using more descriptive names like `num_elements`, `input_values`, `total_value`, `average_value`, `squared_sum_of_values`, and `minimum_value`. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain, as the variable names will provide more context about what each variable represents.\n\nHere's the code with the suggested variable names:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nnum_elements = int(eval(input()))\ninput_values = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_value = sum(input_values) // num_elements\naverage_value = total_value // num_elements\nsquared_sum_of_values = sum(input_values ** 2)\nminimum_value = min(squared_sum_of_values, total_value ** 2)\nprint((minimum_value))\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like more suggestions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use consistent indentation and line breaks throughout the code. The current code uses inconsistent indentation and line breaks, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to use consistent indentation and line breaks to make the code more readable. For example, you could use 4 spaces for each level of indentation, and break long lines into multiple lines to make them easier to read. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n\nHere's the code with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\nnumber_of_questions, query = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsymbol = \"_\" + eval(input()) + \"_\"\nleft_index, right_index = 0, number_of_questions + 1\n\nfor (m, h) in [input().split() for i in range(query)][::-1]:\n    L = h == \"L\"\n    R = h == \"R\"\n    left_index, right_index = [left_index, left_index - 1, left_index + 1][(m == symbol[left_index] and R) - (m == symbol[left_index + 1] and L)],\n                            [right_index, right_index - 1, right_index + 1][(m == symbol[right_index - 1] and R) - (m == symbol[right_index] and L)]\nprint((max(0, right_index - left_index - 1)))\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.
