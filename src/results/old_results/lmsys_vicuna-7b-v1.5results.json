The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\ndef resolve():\n    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\n    n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a = [int(eval(input())) for _ in range(m)]\n\n    dp = np.array([1] * (n + 1))\n    dp[a] = 0\n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if dp[i] != 0:\n            dp[i] = np.sum(dp[i - 2:i]) % MOD\n\n    print((dp[n]))\n    \nresolve()\n```\n\n\nMy suggestion is to add comments to the code to explain what each part of the code is doing. This will make the code easier to understand and maintain. For example, you could add a comment above the `np.array` line to explain what the `dp` array is used for, and a comment above the `print` statement to explain what the `dp[n]` line is doing. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers who may be working on the code in the future.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\nH, W, K = list(map(int, input().split()))\nMOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\n\nHd = sum([d * (H - d) * (W ** 2) for d in range(H)])\nWd = sum([d * (W - d) * (H ** 2) for d in range(W)])\n\n\n# \u968e\u4e57 & \u9006\u5143\u8a08\u7b97\nfactorial = [1]\ninverse = [1]\nfor i in range(1, H * W + 2):\n    factorial.append(factorial[-1] * i % MOD)\n    inverse.append(pow(factorial[-1], MOD - 2, MOD))\n\n\nans = (Hd + Wd) * factorial[H * W - 2] * inverse[K - 2] * inverse[H * W - K] % MOD\nprint(ans)\n\n```\n\n\nMy suggestion is to use comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code. The current code is divided into three sections: the first section calculates the sum of the diagonals of a square matrix, the second section calculates the inverse of the square matrix using the iterative method, and the third section calculates the determinant of a square matrix using the formula `det = (Hd + Wd) * inv(H * W - 2) * inv(H * W - K)`. However, it is not immediately clear from the code what each section is doing. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each section will make the code easier to understand and maintain.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\nn, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\na = [int(eval(input())) for _ in range(m)] + [0]\nmod = 10 ** 9 + 7\n\ndp = np.zeros(n + 1, dtype=np.int64)\ndp[0] = 1\nb = a[0]\nj = 1\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    if i == b:\n        b = a[j]\n        j += 1\n    else:\n        tmp = dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 1]\n        if tmp >= mod:\n            tmp -= mod\n        dp[i] = tmp\nprint((int(dp[-1])))\n```\n\n\nMy suggestion is to use comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code. The current code is difficult to understand because it lacks comments explaining what each part of the code is doing. Adding comments will make the code easier to understand and maintain. For example, you could add comments explaining what the `dp` array is used for, what the `b` and `j` variables are used for, and what the `tmp` variable is used for. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text.

The current code is difficult to understand because it lacks comments explaining what each section of the code is doing. Adding comments will make the code easier to understand and maintain.

The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code.

This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text.

This will make the code easier to understand and maintain. For example, you could add a comment above the `for` loop that explains what the loop is doing, or add a comment above the `cnt` variable that explains what it represents. This will make the code more readable and easier to understand for other developers who may be working on the code in the future.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.
