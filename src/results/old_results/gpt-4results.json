The use of `eval` can be potentially dangerous and is often discouraged, as it will evaluate any expression, which could lead to security issues. Additionally, it's not immediately clear why `eval` is necessary here, since `input()` returns a string and `int()` is typically sufficient for converting it to an integer. A comment explaining the choice would help readers understand the intent and assess whether `eval` is truly needed. If `eval` is not necessary, it would be better to remove it to avoid potential security risks and simplify the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

The current comments are somewhat helpful, but they don't fully explain the reasoning behind each step, especially for readers who might not be familiar with bitwise operations. Creating functions with descriptive names for each operation can greatly enhance readability and make the code more maintainable. For example, a function named `calculateCombinedDifferences` could encapsulate the logic for combining differences, and another named `adjustForOddNumbers` could handle the conditional logic related to odd numbers. This way, the main logic of the code becomes a series of function calls that read almost like a sentence, making the code's purpose clear at a glance.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

The current parameter names `x` and `y` are generic and do not convey any meaning about the values they represent. Using more descriptive names such as `first_number` and `second_number` or `num1` and `num2` would make the function's purpose and the role of its parameters clearer to someone reading the code. This practice of using meaningful variable names helps in understanding the logic of the code without needing to delve into the implementation details.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.
