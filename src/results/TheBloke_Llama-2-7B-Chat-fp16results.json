Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse whitespace more consistently and strategically.\n\nThe code has some areas where there are long sequences of consecutive lines without any whitespace, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, in the line `ans = min(ans, s)`, there are no whitespace between `ans` and `s`, which can make it harder to tell that `ans` is being compared to `s`.\nAdding more whitespace throughout the code can make it easier to read and understand, especially for longer functions or methods. For example, you could add a line of whitespace between the `for` loop and the `s` variable in the line `for i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):`, like this:\n```\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * C + max(0, X - i) * A + max(0, Y - i) * B\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\nThis can make the code easier to read and understand, especially for someone who is not familiar with the code.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse whitespace more consistently to make the code easier to read.\nIn the current code, there are some places where there are long lines of code with very little whitespace, which can make it harder to follow the flow of the code. For example, in the `for` loop in the `ans` calculation, there are only a few whitespace characters between the `for` keyword and the `i` variable. This makes it harder to see the relationship between the `i` variable and the other code in the loop.\nTo improve readability, you could add more whitespace characters throughout the code to make it easier to see the structure of the code. For example, you could add a newline character after the `for` keyword, and then add a few whitespace characters before the `i` variable. This would make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could look with more consistent whitespace:\n```\nA, B, C, X, Y = list(map(int, input().split()))\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * C + max(0, X - i) * A + max(0, Y - i) * B\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\nI hope this helps!

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse consistent indentation and spacing.\nThe current code has inconsistent indentation and spacing, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, some lines have four spaces for indentation, while others have eight. Similarly, some lines have a single space between words, while others have two or three.\nTo improve readability, it would be better to use a consistent indentation and spacing scheme throughout the code. For example, you could use four spaces for indentation and a single space between words. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could be formatted with consistent indentation and spacing:\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nx, y, z, k = list(map(int, input().split()))\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort(reverse=True)\nb.sort(reverse=True)\nc.sort(reverse=True)\n\nabc = []\n\nfor i, _a in enumerate(a):\n    for j, _b in enumerate(b):\n        if (i+1) * (j+1) > k:\n            break\n        for l, _c in enumerate(c):\n            if (i+1) * (j+1) * (l+1) > k:\n                break\n            abc.append(_a + _b + _c)\n\nabc.sort(reverse=True)\nfor x in abc[:k]:\n    print(x)\n```\nI hope this helps!

It would be better to use a consistent number of spaces between words throughout the code.\nHere's an example of how you could improve the code's readability by using consistent indentation and spacing:\n```\nn = int(eval(input()))\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nD = {i: [0] for i in range(1, n+1)}\nfor i in range(n+1):\n  D[a[i]][0] += 1\n  D[a[i]].append(i)\n\npl, pr = 0, 0\nfor i in D:\n  if D[i][0] == 2:\n    pl = D[i][1]\n    pr = D[i][2]\n    break\nL = pl\nM = pr - pl - 1\nN = n - pr\nmod = int(1e9) + 7 # <-- input modulo\nmaxf = n+11          # <-- input factional limitation\n\ndef make_fact(n, k):\n    tmp = n\n    perm = [i for i in range(k)]\n    L = [0 for _ in range(k)]\n    for i in range(k):\n        L[i] = tmp % (i + 1)\n        tmp //= i + 1\n    LL = [0 for _ in range(k)]\n    for i in range(k):\n        LL[i] = perm[L[-i-1]]\n        for j in range(L[-i-1]+1, k):\n            perm[j-1] = perm[j]\n    return LL\n\ndef doubling(n, m, modulo=mod):\n    y = 1\n    base = n\n    tmp = m\n    while tmp!= 0:\n        if tmp % 2 == 1:\n            y *= base\n            if modulo > 0:\n                y %= modulo\n        base *= base\n        if modulo > 0:\n            base %= modulo\n        tmp //= 2\n    return y\n\ndef inved(a, modulo=mod):\n    x, y, u, v, k, l = 1, 0, 0, 1, a, modulo\n    while l!= 0:\n        x, y, u, v = u, v, x - u * (k // l), y - v * (k // l)\n        k, l = l, k % l\n    return x % modulo\n\nfact = [1 for _ in range(maxf+1)]\ninvf = [1 for _ in range(maxf+1)]\n\nfor i in range(maxf):\n    fact[i+1] = (fact[i] * (i+1)) % mod\ninvf[-1] = inved(fact[-1])\nfor i in range(maxf, 0, -1):\n    invf[i-1] = (invf[i] * i) % mod\n\nfor i in range(1, n+2):\n  S = fact[n]*invf[i-1]*invf[n-i+1]%mod\n  if i <= n-1:\n    S += fact[n-1]*invf[i]*invf[n-1-i]%mod\n    S %= mod\n  if i <= n-M:\n    S -= fact[n-1-M]*invf[i-1]*invf[n-M-i]%mod\n    S %= mod\n  if i <= n:\n    S += fact[n-1]*invf[i-1]*invf[n-i]%mod\n    S %= mod\n  print(S)\n```\n\nI hope this helps!

Here's my suggestion for improving readability:\nUse consistent indentation and spacing. The current code has inconsistent indentation and spacing, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, some lines have four spaces for indentation, while others have eight. It would be better to use a consistent number of spaces for indentation throughout the code. Additionally, some lines have multiple spaces between words, while others have only one. It would be better to use a consistent number of spaces between words throughout the code.\nHere's an example of how you could improve the code's readability by using consistent indentation and spacing:\n```\nn = int(eval(input()))\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nD = {i: [0] for i in range(1, n+1)}\nfor i in range(n+1):\n  D[a[i]][0] += 1\n  D[a[i]].append(i)\n\npl, pr = 0, 0\nfor i in D:\n  if D[i][0] == 2:\n    pl = D[i][1]\n    pr = D[i][2]\n    break\nL = pl\nM = pr - pl - 1\nN = n - pr\nmod = int(1e9) + 7 # <-- input modulo\nmaxf = n+11          # <-- input factional limitation\n\ndef make_fact(n, k):\n    tmp = n\n    perm = [i for i in range(k)]\n    L = [0 for _ in range(k)]\n    for i in range(k):\n        L[i] = tmp % (i + 1)\n        tmp //= i + 1\n    LL = [0 for _ in range(k)]\n    for i in range(k):\n        LL[i] = perm[L[-i-1]]\n        for j in range(L[-i-1]+1, k):\n            perm[j-1] = perm[j]\n    return LL\n\ndef doubling(n, m, modulo=mod):\n    y = 1\n    base = n\n    tmp = m\n    while tmp!= 0:\n        if tmp % 2 == 1:\n            y *= base\n            if modulo > 0:\n                y %= modulo\n        base *= base\n        if modulo > 0:\n            base %= modulo\n        tmp //= 2\n    return y\n\ndef inved(a, modulo=mod):\n    x, y, u, v, k, l = 1, 0, 0, 1, a, modulo\n    while l!= 0:\n        x, y, u, v = u, v, x - u * (k // l), y - v * (k // l)\n        k, l = l, k % l\n    return x % modulo\n\nfact = [1 for _ in range(maxf+1)]\ninvf = [1 for _ in range(maxf+1)]\n\nfor i in range(maxf):\n    fact[i+1] = (fact[i] * (i+1)) % mod\ninvf[-1] = inved(fact[-1])\nfor i in range(maxf, 0, -1):\n    invf[i-1] = (invf[i] * i) % mod\n\nfor i in range(1, n+2):\n  S = fact[n]*invf[i-1]*invf[n-i+1]%mod\n  if i <= n-1:\n    S += fact[n-1]*invf[i]*invf[n-1-i]%mod\n    S %= mod\n  if i <= n-M:\n    S -= fact[n-1-M]*invf[i-1]*invf[n-M-i]%mod\n    S %= mod\n  if i <= n:\n    S += fact[n-1]*invf[i-1]*invf[n-i]%mod\n    S %= mod\n  print(S)\n```\n\nI hope this helps!

The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code.

        "feedback": "Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse whitespace more consistently and strategically.\n\nThe code has some areas where there are long sequences of consecutive lines without any whitespace, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, in the line `ans = min(ans, s)`, there are no whitespace between `ans` and `s`, which can make it harder to tell that `ans` is being compared to `s`.\nAdding more whitespace throughout the code can make it easier to read and understand, especially for longer functions or methods.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse whitespace more consistently and strategically.\n\nThe code has some areas where there are long sequences of consecutive lines without any whitespace, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, in the line `ans = min(ans, s)`, there are no whitespace between `ans` and `s`, which can make it harder to tell that `ans` is being compared to `s`.\nAdding more whitespace throughout the code can make it easier to read and understand, especially for longer functions or methods.

For example:\n```\nn = int(eval(input()))  # number of input lines\n\nabn = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]  # list of lists of integers\nabn.sort()  # sort the list of lists of integers\nabn.sort(key = lambda x:x[1])  # sort the list of lists of integers by the second element\n\n# print the sorted list of lists of integers\n\nts = 0  # time_stamp\nenable = True  # flag to indicate whether the input is valid\nfor abi in abn:  # loop over the list of lists of integers\n    a, b = abi  # get the two integers from the current list of lists\n    # check if the time stamp is less than or equal to the sum of the two integers\n    if not ts + a <= b:\n        enable = False  # set the flag to False if the time stamp is not less than or equal to the sum of the two integers\n        break  # break out of the loop\n    else:\n        ts += a  # update the time stamp\n\nprint(('Yes' if enable else 'No'))  # print \"Yes\" if the input is valid, or \"No\" otherwise\n```\nBy adding comments to explain the purpose of each variable and function, the code becomes easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could be improved:\n```\ndef isPrime(x):\n    if x == 2:\n        return True\n    if x < 2 or x % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i, root_x = 3, int(pow(x, 0.5))\n    while i <= root_x:\n        if x % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n\nprimes = [2]\nfor i in range(3, 104730):\n    if isPrime(i):\n        primes.append(primes[-1]+i)\nwhile True:\n    n = int(eval(input()))\n    if n == 0:\n        break\n    print((primes[n-1])) \n```\nBy using consistent indentation and spacing, the code is easier to read and understand, and the reader can focus on the logic of the code without getting distracted by the inconsistent formatting.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could look with consistent indentation and spacing:\n```\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque\nfrom heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush\nfrom bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right\nimport sys, math, itertools, string, queue\nsys.setrecursionlimit(10**8)\nmod = 10**9 + 7\ndef inp(): return int(sys.stdin.readline())\ndef inpl(): return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\ndef inpl_str(): return list(sys.stdin.readline().split())\ndef inpln(n): return list(int(sys.stdin.readline()) for i in range(n))\n\nn, m = inpl()\na = inpl()\nb = [0] * m\n\nfor i in range(m):\n    x, y = inpl()\n    b[i] = [x, y]\na.sort()\nb.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\nres = sum(a)\ni = 0\nj = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    # print(i, j)\n    if a[i] < b[j][1]:\n        res += b[j][1] - a[i]\n        i += 1\n    else:\n        break\n    b[j][0] -= 1\n    if b[j][0] == 0:\n        j += 1\n    if i >= n or j >= m:\n        break\n\nprint(res)\n```\nBy using consistent indentation and spacing, the code becomes easier to read and understand, and the reader can focus more on the logic of the code rather than getting distracted by the inconsistent formatting.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse consistent line lengths. The code has varying line lengths, which can make it harder to read and understand. Try to keep each line of code to a consistent length, ideally around 79-80 characters or less. This will make the code more readable and easier to follow.\n\nI hope this helps!

For example, in the `for` loop, you could add a line of whitespace between the `a.append()` and `b.append()` lines to make it clearer what each line of the loop is doing. Similarly, in the `if` statement, you could add a line of whitespace between the `max()` function call and the `print()` statement to make it clearer what the code is doing.\nHere's an example of how the code could look with more consistent whitespace:\n```\ndef main():\n  n = int(eval(input()))\n  a = [0]\n  b = [0]\n  c = [0]\n  for i in range(n):\n      aa,bb,cc = list(map(int,input().split()))\n      a.append(max(b[i] + aa, c[i] + aa))\n      b.append(max(a[i] + bb, c[i] + bb))\n      c.append(max(a[i] + cc, b[i] + cc))\n  print((max(a[-1], b[-1], c[-1])))\nmain()\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Similarly, some lines have a single space between words, while others have two or three.\nTo improve readability, it would be better to use a consistent indentation and spacing scheme throughout the code. For example, you could use four spaces for indentation and a single space between words. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could look with consistent indentation and spacing:\n```\nimport sys\ne = [list(map(int, e.split())) for e in sys.stdin]\nn = e[0][0] + 1\nfor c in e[1:n]:\n    t = ''\n    for l in zip(*e[n:]):\n        t += f'{sum(s * t for s, t in zip(c, l))}'\nprint((t[:-1]))\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Additionally, some lines have a single space between words, while others have two or three spaces.\nTo improve readability, it would be better to use a consistent indentation and spacing scheme throughout the code. For example, you could use four spaces for indentation and a consistent number of spaces between words. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could be improved:\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nN, M, *A = list(map(int, open(0).read().split()))\n\ndef lcm(x, y):\n    return x * y // gcd(x, y)\n\ndef sub_by_2(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        n //= 2\n        cnt += 1\n    return cnt\n\nlcm_2 = [sub_by_2(n // 2) for n in A]\nif all(lcm_2[0] == v for v in lcm_2):\n    num = reduce(lcm, [v // 2 for v in A])\n    res = M // num\n    print((res // 2 + res % 2))\nelse:\n    print((0))\n```\nBy using consistent indentation and spacing, the code is easier to read and understand, and the reader can focus on the logic of the code without getting distracted by the inconsistent formatting.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse whitespace and indentation consistently throughout the code.\nIn the current code, there are some places where there are too many consecutive lines of code without any whitespace or indentation.

The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nFinish this code critique:\nI have some code. Can you give one suggestion to improve readability.

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse descriptive variable names:\nIn the current code, many of the variable names are quite short and don't provide much information about what the variable represents. For example, `n` is just an integer value without any context, and `a` is a list of integers without any indication of what it represents.\nTo improve readability, consider using more descriptive variable names that provide context and help the reader understand what the variable is used for. For example, you could rename `n` to `problemSize` or `inputSize`, and `a` to `integerList` or `inputValues`.\nBy using more descriptive variable names, you can make the code easier to understand and follow, especially for readers who are not familiar with the code.",

For example, `n` is just an integer value without any context, and `a` is a list of integers without any indication of what it represents.\nTo improve readability, consider using more descriptive variable names that provide context and help the reader understand what the variable is used for. For example, you could rename `n` to `problemSize` or `inputSize`, and `a` to `integerList` or `inputValues`.\nBy using more descriptive variable names, you can make the code easier to understand and follow, especially for readers who are not familiar with the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse descriptive variable names instead of single-letter variable names.\nIn the current code, many of the variable names are just single letters or abbreviations (e.g. `A`, `B`, `C`, `X`, `Y`). While this can be efficient for small programs, it can make the code harder to read and understand for larger programs.\nInstead, consider using more descriptive variable names that clearly indicate their purpose. For example, you could rename `A` to `total`, `B` to `base`, `C` to `factor`, `X` to `input`, and `Y` to `output`.

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse consistent indentation and spacing.\nThe current code has inconsistent indentation and spacing, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, some lines have four spaces for indentation, while others have eight. Similarly, some lines have a single space between words, while others have two or three.\nTo improve readability, it would be better to use a consistent indentation and spacing scheme throughout the code. For example, you could use four spaces for indentation and a single space between words. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could be formatted with consistent indentation and spacing:\n```\ndef main():\n    from itertools import permutations\n    n, m, r, *x = list(map(int, open(0).read().split()))\n    to = x[:r]\n    dis = [[float(\"Inf\")] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        dis[i][i] = 0\n    for a, b, c in zip(*[iter(x[r:])] * 3):\n        dis[a][b] = c\n        dis[b][a] = c\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            for j in range(1, n + 1):\n                dis[i][j] = min(dis[i][j], dis[i][k] + dis[k][j])\n    ans = float(\"Inf\")\n    for p in permutations(to):\n        tmp = 0\n        nw = p[0]\n        for nx in p[1:]:\n            tmp += dis[nw][nx]\n            nw = nx\n        ans = min(ans, tmp)\n    print(ans)\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\nBy using consistent indentation and spacing, the code is easier to read and understand, and the reader can focus on the logic of the code without getting distracted by the formatting.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse descriptive variable names:\nThe current code uses very generic variable names like `I`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `qq`. These names don't give much information about what the variables represent, which can make the code harder to understand.\nTo improve readability, consider using more descriptive variable names that clearly indicate their purpose. For example, you could rename `I` to `input_values`, `n` to `number_of_inputs`, `m` to `max_value`, `a` to `answer`, and `qq` to `quiz_questions`.\nBy using more descriptive variable names, you can make the code easier to understand and follow, even for someone who hasn't worked with the code before.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\n```\na, b, c = list(map(int, input().split()))\ne = (a - b) | (b - c)\nprint((bool(e | (a | b | c) % 2) * (e ** ~ - e).bit_length() - 1))\n```\n```\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse whitespace more consistently to make the code easier to read. In the current code, there are some lines that are quite long and could benefit from more whitespace to make them easier to understand. For example, the line `e = (a - b) | (b - c)` could be broken up into two lines for better readability: `e1 = a - b` and `e2 = b - c`. Similarly, the line `print((bool(e | (a | b | c) % 2) * (e ** ~ - e).bit_length() - 1))` could be broken up into three lines for better readability: `print((bool(e) * (e ** ~ - e).bit_length() - 1))` followed by `e = (a | b | c) % 2` followed by `print(e)`.\nBy using more whitespace, you can make the code easier to read and understand, which can help you catch errors and bugs more quickly.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse consistent indentation and spacing.\nIn the current code, the indentation and spacing of the code are not consistent, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, some lines have four spaces for indentation, while others have eight. Additionally, some lines have a single space between words, while others have two or more spaces.\nTo improve readability, it would be better to use a consistent indentation and spacing scheme throughout the code. For example, you could use four spaces for indentation and a consistent number of spaces between words. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could be improved:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nN, D = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprint((int(np.ceil(N/(2*D+1)))))\ntotalA, totalB, totalC, maxX, maxY = list(map(int, input().split()))\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * totalC + max(0, maxX - i) * totalA + max(0, maxY - i) * totalB\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Here's a suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\nUse whitespace and indentation consistently throughout the code.\nIn the current code, there are some places where there are no spaces between variables or operators, and other places where there are too many spaces. For example, in the line `ans = min(ans, s)`, there are no spaces between `ans` and `s`. This can make the code harder to read and understand.\nAdditionally, there are some places where the indentation is inconsistent. For example, in the loop `for i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):`, the indentation is inconsistent between the `s` assignment and the `ans = min(ans, s)` line.\nBy using consistent whitespace and indentation throughout the code, you can make it easier for others to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could be improved:\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n    # Add some whitespace and indentation to make the code easier to read\nL = [0 for i in range(a + 1)]\nR = [0 for i in range(b + 1)]\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    l, r = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    L[l] += 1\n    R[r] += 1\n    cnt = 0\n    for i in range(a + 1):\n        cnt += L[i]\n        if cnt == r:\n            cnt += 1\n    print(cnt)\n```\nBy using consistent whitespace and indentation throughout the code, you can make it easier for others to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Similarly, some lines have a single space between words, while others have two or three.\nTo improve readability, it would be better to use a consistent indentation and spacing scheme throughout the code. For example, you could use four spaces for indentation and a single space between words. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\nHere's an example of how the code could be formatted with consistent indentation and spacing:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nn = int(eval(input()))\ninput_X = [[int(i) for i in input().split()] for i in range(n)]\nX = np.array(input_X)\npre_t = 0\npre_x = 0\npre_y = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    x_move = abs(X[i][1] - pre_x)\n    y_move = abs(X[i][2] - pre_y)\n    xy_sum = x_move + y_move\n    spend_time = X[i][0] - pre_t\n    if xy_sum % 2 == spend_time % 2 and spend_time >= xy_sum:\n        pre_t = X[i][0]\n        pre_x = X[i][1]\n        pre_y = X[i][2]\n        if i + 1 == n:\n            print('Yes')\n        else:\n            continue\n    else:\n        print('No')\n        break\n```\nI hope this helps!

For example, `A`, `B`, `C`, `X`, and `Y` are all very short and don't give any indication of what they represent. It would be better to use more descriptive variable names that give a clear idea of what each variable represents. For example, you could use `numA`, `numB`, `numC`, `maxX`, and `maxY` instead. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.
