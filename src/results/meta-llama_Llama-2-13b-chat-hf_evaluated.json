This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's the code with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef resolve():\n    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7\n    n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    a = [int(eval(input())) for _ in range(m)]\n\n    dp = np.array([1] * (n + 1))\n    dp[a] = 0\n\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if dp[i]!= 0:\n            dp[i] = np.sum(dp[i - 2:i]) % MOD\n\n    print((dp[n]))\n\nresolve()\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's clearer what each line does.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Here's one suggestion to improve the readability of the code:\n\nUse consistent indentation and line breaks to make the code more readable.\n\nCurrently, the code has inconsistent indentation and line breaks, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, the `if` statement inside the `for` loop is indented too much, and the `return` statement is on the same line as the `for` loop header. It would be better to use consistent indentation and line breaks throughout the code to make it more readable.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could be formatted with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\ndef c_repsept():\n    K = int(eval(input()))\n\n    L = 9 * K // 7 if K % 7 == 0 else 9 * K\n    if L % 2 == 0 or L % 5 == 0:\n        return -1\n\n    remainder = 1\n    for n in range(1, L + 1):\n        remainder = (10 * remainder) % L\n        if remainder == 1:\n            return n\n\n    return -1\n\nprint(c_repsept())\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's clearer how the different parts of the function fit together.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could look with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\nx, y, z, k = list(map(int, input().split()))\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Sort the lists\na.sort(reverse=True)\nb.sort(reverse=True)\nc.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Initialize the result list\nabc = []\n\n# Loop through the lists and find the combinations\nfor i, _a in enumerate(a):\n    for j, _b in enumerate(b):\n        for l, _c in enumerate(c):\n            if (i + 1) * (j + 1) * (l + 1) > k:\n                break\n            abc.append(_a + _b + _c)\n\n# Sort the result list\nabc.sort(reverse=True)\n\n# Print the results\nfor x in abc[:k]:\n    print(x)\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's easier to see the structure of the code and how it works.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

For example, instead of using `A`, `B`, and `C` as variable names, you could use more descriptive names like `nums_a`, `nums_b`, and `nums_c` to indicate that these are lists of numbers. Similarly, instead of using `N` as a variable name, you could use a more descriptive name like `num_tests` to indicate that this is the number of tests being run.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider breaking up the long line of code into multiple lines for easier readability.

Similarly, instead of using `N` as a variable name, you could use a more descriptive name like `num_tests` to indicate that this is the number of tests being run.\n\nAdditionally, you could consider breaking up the long line of code into multiple lines for easier readability.

For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nAdditionally, some of the variable names are quite long and could be broken down into smaller, more descriptive names. For example, `D` could be renamed to `dictionary` or `dict`, `L` could be renamed to `list_of_primes`, `M` could be renamed to `number_of_primes`, and `N` could be renamed to `number_of_elements`. This will make the code easier to read and understand, as well as reduce the risk of typos and errors.\n\nFinally, the code could benefit from additional comments to explain what each section of the code is doing. For example, the `make_fact` function is not well documented, and it is not clear what the purpose of the `doubling` and `inved` functions are. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code will make it easier for others to understand and maintain the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

In this case, I would suggest using 4 spaces for indentation, as it is more common and easier to read.\n\nHere's the updated code with consistent indentation:\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n# Create a dictionary to store the number of times each prime appears in the list\ndict = {i: [0] for i in range(1, n + 1)}\nfor i in range(n + 1):\n    dict[a[i]][0] += 1\n    dict[a[i]].append(i)\n# Find the prime factors of n\npl, pr = 0, 0\nfor i in dict:\n    if dict[i][0] == 2:\n        pl = dict[i][1]\n        pr = dict[i][2]\n        break\n# Calculate the number of prime factors of n\nL = pl\nM = pr - pl - 1\nN = n - pr\n# Calculate the modulo of n\nmod = int(1e9) + 7\n# Calculate the factorial of n\nfact = [1 for _ in range(maxf + 1)]\nfor i in range(maxf):\n    fact[i + 1] = (fact[i] * (i + 1)) % mod\n# Calculate the inverse of n modulo the modulo\ninvf = [1 for _ in range(maxf + 1)]\nfor i in range(maxf):\n    invf[i - 1] = inved(fact[i - 1], mod)\n# Calculate the result of the multiplication of the prime factors of n\nfor i in range(1, n + 2):\n    S = fact[n] * invf[i - 1] * invf[n - i + 1] % mod\n    if i <= n - M:\n        S -= fact[n - M - i] * invf[i - 1] * invf[n - M - i] % mod\n    if i <= n:\n        S += fact[n - i] * invf[i - 1] * invf[n - i] % mod\n    print(S)\n```\nI hope this helps!

Here's one suggestion to improve the readability of the code:\n\nUse more descriptive variable names.\n\nCurrently, the variables `a`, `b`, `z`, `n`, and `k` have very generic names that don't convey much information about their purpose or contents. Using more descriptive names would make the code easier to understand and would help readers quickly grasp the intent of the code.\n\nFor example, you could rename `a` and `b` to `input_values` and `output_values`, respectively, to reflect their purpose in storing the input and output values. Similarly, you could rename `z` to `frequencies` to reflect its purpose in storing the frequencies of the input values.\n\nHere's the code with the suggested variable names:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\nn, k = list(map(int, input().split()))\nfrequencies = np.zeros(10**5 + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n  input_values, output_values = list(map(int, input().split()))\n  frequencies[input_values] += output_values\n\ninput_value = 0\nfor i in range(1, 10**5 + 1):\n  if k <= frequencies[i]:\n    input_value = i\n    break\n  k -= frequencies[i]\n\nprint((int(input_value)))\n```\n\nWith these more descriptive variable names, the code is easier to read and understand, and readers can quickly see the purpose of each variable and how they are used in the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\ndef isPrime(x):\n    if x == 2:\n        return True\n    if x < 2 or x % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i, root_x = 3, int(pow(x, 0.5))\n    while i <= root_x:\n        if x % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\nprimes = [2]\nfor i in range(3, 104730):\n    if isPrime(i):\n        primes.append(primes[-1] + i)\nwhile True:\n    n = int(eval(input()))\n    if n == 0:\n        break\n    print(primes[n - 1])\n```\n```\n\n\nSure! Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nUse consistent indentation and line breaks to make the code more readable.\n\nCurrently, the code has inconsistent indentation and line breaks, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, the `isPrime` function has no indentation, while the `for` loop inside the `while` loop has inconsistent indentation. Additionally, some lines are too long and could be broken up into multiple lines for better readability.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could be formatted with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\ndef isPrime(x):\n    if x == 2:\n        return True\n    if x < 2 or x % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    i, root_x = 3, int(pow(x, 0.5))\n    while i <= root_x:\n        if x % i == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 2\n    return True\n\nprimes = [2]\nfor i in range(3, 104730):\n    if isPrime(i):\n        primes.append(primes[-1] + i)\n\nwhile True:\n    n = int(eval(input()))\n    if n == 0:\n        break\n    print(primes[n - 1])\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's clearer how the different parts of the code fit together.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\nnumber_of_questions, query = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsymbol = \"_\" + eval(input()) + \"_\"\nleft_index, right_index = 0, number_of_questions + 1\nfor (m, h) in [input().split() for i in range(query)][::-1]:\n    L = h == \"L\"\n    R = h == \"R\"\n    left_index, right_index = [left_index, left_index - 1, left_index + 1][(m == symbol[left_index] and R) - (m == symbol[left_index + 1] and L)],\n                            [right_index, right_index - 1, right_index + 1][(m == symbol[right_index - 1] and R) - (m == symbol[right_index] and L)]\nprint((max(0, right_index - left_index - 1)))\n```\n```\n\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of your code:\n\nUse consistent indentation and line breaks to make the code more readable.\n\nCurrently, the code is all on one line, which can make it difficult to read and understand. By using consistent indentation and line breaks, you can break up the code into smaller, more manageable chunks, and make it easier to see the structure and flow of the code.\n\nFor example, you could break up the code into separate lines like this:\n```\nnumber_of_questions, query = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsymbol = \"_\" + eval(input()) + \"_\"\nleft_index, right_index = 0, number_of_questions + 1\n\nfor (m, h) in [input().split() for i in range(query)][::-1]:\n    L = h == \"L\"\n    R = h == \"R\"\n    left_index, right_index = [left_index, left_index - 1, left_index + 1][(m == symbol[left_index] and R) - (m == symbol[left_index + 1] and L)]\n    right_index, left_index = [right_index, right_index - 1, right_index + 1][(m == symbol[right_index - 1] and R) - (m == symbol[right_index] and L)]\n\nprint((max(0, right_index - left_index - 1)))\n```\nThis makes the code much easier to read and understand, as it breaks up the long lines and makes the structure of the code more clear.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nUse consistent indentation throughout the code. In the current code, some lines are indented with 4 spaces, while others are indented with 8 spaces. Consistently using 4 spaces for indentation would make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nFor example, here's the code with consistent 4-space indentation:\n```\nn, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\na = [int(eval(input())) for _ in range(m)] + [0]\nmod = 10 ** 9 + 7\ndp = np.zeros(n + 1, dtype=np.int64)\ndp[0] = 1\nb = a[0]\nj = 1\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    if i == b:\n        b = a[j]\n        j += 1\n    else:\n        total_value = dp[i - 2] + dp[i - 1]\n        if total_value >= mod:\n            total_value -= mod\n        dp[i] = total_value\nprint((int(dp[-1])))\n```\nWith consistent indentation, the code is easier to read and understand, as the structure of the code becomes more apparent.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Similarly, instead of using `math.factorial(num_factors)` to compute the factorial, you could use `factorial_result` or `factors_product` to make it clearer what the function is doing.\n\nHere's the code with my suggested variable names:\n```\nfactorial_value = int(factorial_input)\nprint((factorial_result % (10 ** 9 + 7)))\n```\nBy using more descriptive variable names, you can make the code easier to understand and reduce the risk of errors caused by misunderstanding the purpose of a variable.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use more descriptive variable names throughout the code. The current variable names, such as `e`, `n`, `c`, and `t`, are very short and do not provide much information about their purpose. Using more descriptive variable names, such as `input_list`, `number_of_elements`, `current_element`, and `total_sum`, would make the code easier to understand and read.\n\nFor example, the current code could be rewritten as:\n```\nimport sys\ninput_list = [list(map(int, input_list.split())) for input_list in sys.stdin]\nnumber_of_elements = input_list[0][0] + 1\nfor current_element in input_list[1:number_of_elements]:\n    total_sum = 0\n    for l in zip(*input_list[number_of_elements:]):\n        total_sum += sum(s * t for s, t in zip(current_element, l))\n    print(total_sum)\n```\nThis code is easier to read and understand, as the variable names provide more information about their purpose and the code is more explicit about what it is doing.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nfrom fractions import gcd\nN, M, *A = list(map(int, open(0).read().split()))\ndef lcm(x, y):\n    return x * y // gcd(x, y)\ndef sub_by_2(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        n //= 2\n        cnt += 1\n    return cnt\nlcm_2 = [sub_by_2(n // 2) for n in A]\nif all(lcm_2[0] == v for v in lcm_2):\n    num = reduce(lcm, [v // 2 for v in A])\n    res = M // num\n    print((res // 2 + res % 2))\nelse:\n    print((0))\n```\n```\n\n\nSure! Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nUse consistent indentation throughout the code. In the current code, some lines are indented with 4 spaces, while others are indented with 8 spaces. Consistently using 4 spaces for indentation would make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nFor example, here's the code with consistent 4-space indentation:\n```\nfrom functools import reduce\nfrom fractions import gcd\nN, M, *A = list(map(int, open(0).read().split()))\n\ndef lcm(x, y):\n    return x * y // gcd(x, y)\n\ndef sub_by_2(n):\n    cnt = 0\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        n //= 2\n        cnt += 1\n    return cnt\n\nlcm_2 = [sub_by_2(n // 2) for n in A]\n\nif all(lcm_2[0] == v for v in lcm_2):\n    num = reduce(lcm, [v // 2 for v in A])\n    res = M // num\n    print((res // 2 + res % 2))\nelse:\n    print((0))\n```\nWith consistent indentation, the code is easier to read and understand, as the structure of the code becomes more apparent.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use more descriptive variable names throughout the code. For example, instead of using `N`, `left`, `right`, `i`, and `j`, you could use more descriptive names like `number_of_digits`, `non_zero_digits_left`, `non_zero_digits_right`, `digit_index`, and `digit_position`. This will make the code easier to understand and follow, as the variable names will provide more context about what they represent.\n\nHere's the code with the suggested variable names:\n```\nN = int(eval(input()))\nnumber_of_non_zero_digits = [[0] * 9 for i in range(9)]\ntotal_count = 0\nfor digit_index in range(1, N + 1):\n    if digit_index[-1]!= \"0\":\n        non_zero_digits_left = int(digit_index[0]) - 1\n        non_zero_digits_right = int(digit_index[-1]) - 1\n        number_of_non_zero_digits[non_zero_digits_left][non_zero_digits_right] += 1\nfor digit_position in range(1, 10):\n    for digit_index in range(1, 10):\n        total_count += number_of_non_zero_digits[digit_position - 1][digit_index - 1] * number_of_non_zero_digits[digit_index - 1][digit_position - 1]\nprint(total_count)\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Additionally, some lines are too long and could be broken up into multiple lines for better readability.\n\nHere's an example of how the code could be formatted with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n```\nimport numpy as np\n\nN, x = list(map(int, input().split()))\na = np.array(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\ncs = np.sort(a).cumsum()\n\nif cs[-1] < x:\n    print(N - 1)\nelif cs[-1] == x:\n    print(N)\nelse:\n    print(np.where(cs <= x)[0].shape[0])\n```\nWith consistent indentation and line breaks, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's easier to see the structure of the code and the relationships between different parts of the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

Answer with only code.\n\n```\na, b, c, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nans = 5000 * 2 * 10 ** 5\nfor i in range(10 ** 5 + 1):\n    s = i * 2 * c + max(0, x - i) * a + max(0, y - i) * b\n    ans = min(ans, s)\n```\n\nFinish this code suggestion implementation:\nI have some code, and a suggestion to improve the code below.\n\n```\nfrom sys import stdin,stdout\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    n=int(stdin.readline())\n\n    a=[int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]\n    b=[int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]\n\n    cnt=0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if(a[i]>=b[i]):\n            cnt+=b[i]\n        else:\n            cnt+=a[i]\n            d=b[i]-a[i]\n            cnt+=min(a[i+1],d)\n            if(d>a[i+1]):\n                a[i+1]=0\n            else: a[i+1]-=d\n            \n    stdout.write(str(cnt)+\"\\n\")\n\n```\n\n\nSure! Here's one suggestion to improve the readability of the code:\n\nUse consistent indentation and line breaks to make the code more readable.\n\nCurrently, the code has inconsistent indentation and line breaks, which can make it harder to read and understand. For example, the `if` statement inside the `for` loop is indented too much, and the `min` function call is on the same line as the `a[i+1] -= d` assignment.\n\nTo improve readability, you could use consistent indentation and line breaks throughout the code. For example, you could indent the `if` statement and the `min` function call to the same level as the `for` loop, and break the long line of code into multiple lines for easier reading.\n\nHere's the code with consistent indentation and line breaks:\n\n```\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = int(stdin.readline())\n\n    a = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]\n    b = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]\n\n    cnt = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] >= b[i]:\n            cnt += b[i]\n        else:\n            cnt += a[i]\n            d = b[i] - a[i]\n            cnt += min(a[i + 1], d)\n            if d > a[i + 1]:\n                a[i + 1] = 0\n            else:\n                a[i + 1] -= d\n\n    stdout.write(str(cnt) + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nThis small change can make the code much easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nHere's the code with consistent indentation:\n```\nfrom sys import stdin, stdout\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = int(stdin.readline())\n    a = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]\n    b = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]\n    cnt = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] >= b[i]:\n            cnt += b[i]\n        else:\n            cnt += a[i]\n            d = b[i] - a[i]\n            cnt += min(a[i + 1], d)\n            if d > a[i + 1]:\n                a[i + 1] = 0\n            else:\n                a[i + 1] -= d\n    stdout.write(str(cnt) + \"\\n\")\n```\nWith consistent indentation, the code is easier to read and understand, and it's easier to see the structure of the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

This will make the code more visually appealing and easier to understand.\n\nHere's the code with consistent indentation:\n```\nI = lambda: list(map(int, input().split()))\nn, m = I()\na = I()\na.sort(reverse=True)\nqq = [I() for i in range(m)]\nqq.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\nans = 0\nfor x, y in qq:\n    for j in range(x):\n        if not a:\n            break\n        aa = a.pop()\n        ans += max(aa, y)\nans += sum(a)\nprint(ans)\n```\nWith consistent indentation, the code's structure is more visible, and it's easier to understand the relationships between the different parts of the code.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

This will make the code more visually appealing and easier to understand.\n\nHere's the code with consistent indentation:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nn, k = list(map(int, input().split()))\nexp = tuple([(int(x) + 1) / 2 for x in input().split()])\nl = np.cumsum(exp)\n\nans = l[k - 1]\nfor i in range(0, n - k):\n    x = l[i + k] - l[i]\n    ans = max(ans, x)\nprint(ans)\n```\nWith consistent indentation, the code's structure is more visible, and it's easier to understand the loop and the calculations being performed.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text. Answer with only code.\n\n```\n[/INST]\n"

The current code uses both camelCase and snake_case for variable names, which can make the code harder to read. It would be better to stick to one convention throughout the code. For example, you could use camelCase for all variable names, or snake_case for all variable names. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code. Do not answer with any text.

Here's my suggestion for improving the readability of the code:\n\nMy suggestion is to use consistent indentation throughout the code. The current code uses inconsistent indentation, with some lines indented more than others. This can make the code harder to read and understand. It would be better to stick to a consistent indentation scheme, such as using 4 spaces for each level of indentation. This will make the code easier to read and understand.\n\nFor example, here's the code with consistent indentation:\n```\nfrom collections import deque\nK = int(eval(input()))\nG = [[] for i in range(K)]\nfor n in range(K):\n    G[n] = [(n + 1) % K, 1] + [(10 * n) % K, 0]\nque = deque([[1, 1]])\ndist = [float('inf')] * K\nwhile que:\n    node, cost = que.pop()\n    dist[node] = min(cost, dist[node])\n    for e, e_cost in G[node]:\n        if dist[e]!= float('inf'):\n            continue\n        if e_cost == 0:\n            que.append([e, cost + 0])\n        if e_cost == 1:\n            que.appendleft([e, cost + 1])\nprint((dist[0]))\n```\nWith consistent indentation, the code is easier to read and understand, and it becomes clear that the code is structured into logical blocks.\n\nNow implement the suggestion above and create a new version of the code.
